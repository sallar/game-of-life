# Conway's Game of Life

This is my implementation of the Convay's Game of Life in Rust and Javascript. I made this according to [this guide](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-wasm/game-of-life/introduction.html) just to get better at Rust.

The output is available [here](https://sallar.github.io/game-of-life/) and it currently only works in FireFox.
